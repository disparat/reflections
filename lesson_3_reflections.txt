Why might you want to always pull changes
manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

One reason is that someone else could have
made the changes and it isn't certain that
you want those changes locally.

Describe the differences between forks,
clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

Make a clone to make a copy of a repository.
Make a fork if you want to make the clone
directly from github and if you want
some information saved about from where/who
you got the fork. Also that makes it easier
to make suggestions to the original author.
Branches are just different paths of commits
in a repository - to separate new features or
for some other reason.
