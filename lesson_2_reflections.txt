What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a repository without any commits. It
creates a hidden folder for all the different
versions of the files, metadata about them and
so on.

How is the staging area different from the working
directory and the repository? What value do you
think it offers?

The staging area is like place in the middle where
you put all the files you want to commit when the
next commit is made. It makes it possible to
select the files you wish to be part of the commit
and that is a good thing.
